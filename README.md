## Contributing

Add Snippets that are generally used by others in the [`snippets/python.code-snippets`](/snippets/python.code-snippets)

if you are editing the file in VS Code, you have access to the `snip` snippet which automatically populates the document with a skeleton for snippet. Use that!

commit messages should be strictly of the following format

```
[ADD|UPDATE|FIX|PATCH] commit title

Extended Description if any, not compulsory.
```

keep the titles imperative and as short as possible.
